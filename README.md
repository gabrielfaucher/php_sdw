# PHP Exercises SDW20

This where all my exercises for the PHP class live.
They are seperated into folders for each period, and the exercises that require versions are seperated into version files.
Every exercise/task related to this class will be first added as an issue, then a Trello card will be assigned to it, and 
when the issue has been resolved I will create a pull request and merge it into the master branch. Hopefully this creates a 
clear and clean repository structure & workflow that sort of mimics that one of a production-ready application.
